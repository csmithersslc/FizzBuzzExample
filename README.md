#Fizz Buzz Example

Feature: Uses the Jinja2 Template library for back-end web forms.

This is a project that demonstrates use of Python for back-end development using the Jinja tool (http://jinja.pocoo.org/) as a powerful alternative to Django. Google App Engine was used as a server (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs).

To run this project, download it onto a machine with Python installed (obtained at python.org).  Set your Path variable for Python.

The problem this commit solves is that often templates are needed in back-end web forms that are cumbersome and unappealing with regular Python programming.  This helps make a simple template with Jinja that is powerful for multiple uses in templates with all the tools Jinja has to offer. This is a template, so it doesn't have any special functions like querying though they can be added in additiont to the template.   

Issues: This commit is made to create a better readme so that users can understand the purpose of the project as well as previous commits.
