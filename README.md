# FizzBuzzExample

This is a project that demonstrates use of Python for back-end development using the Jinja tool as a more powerful alternative to Django.
Google App Engine was used as a server.

To run this project, download it onto a machine with Python installed (obtained at python.org).  Set your Path variable for Python.

Once you have Python, simply add the jinja library by using the pip command "pip install jinja2".

This project can then be run in the browser and in Python to check the code.
